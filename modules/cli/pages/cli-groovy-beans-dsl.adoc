== Developing application with the Groovy beans DSL
Spring Framework 4.0 has native support for a `beans{}` "`DSL`" (borrowed from
http://grails.org/[Grails]),  and you can embed bean definitions in your Groovy
application scripts using the same format. This is sometimes a good way to include
external features like middleware declarations. For example:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
	@Configuration
	class Application implements CommandLineRunner {

		@Autowired
		SharedService service

		@Override
		void run(String... args) {
			println service.message
		}

	}

	import my.company.SharedService

	beans {
		service(SharedService) {
			message = "Hello World"
		}
	}
----

You can mix class declarations with `beans{}` in the same file as long as they stay at
the top level, or you can put the beans DSL in a separate file if you prefer.
