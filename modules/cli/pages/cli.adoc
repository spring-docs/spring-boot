= Spring Boot CLI


--
The Spring Boot CLI is a command line tool that can be used if you want to quickly
develop with Spring. It allows you to run Groovy scripts, which means that you have a
familiar Java-like syntax, without so much boilerplate code. You can also bootstrap
a new project or write your own command for it.
