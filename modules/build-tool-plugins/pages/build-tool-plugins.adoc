= Build tool plugins


--
Spring Boot provides build tool plugins for Maven and Gradle. The plugins offer a
variety of features, including the packaging of executable jars. This section provides
more details on both plugins, as well as some help should you need to extend an
unsupported build system. If you are just getting started, you might want to read
"`xref:using-boot:using-boot-build-systems.adoc#using-boot-build-systems[using-boot-build-systems]`" from the
xref:using-boot:using-boot.adoc#using-boot[using-boot] section first.
