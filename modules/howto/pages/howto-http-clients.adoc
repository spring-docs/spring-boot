=== Configure RestTemplate to use a proxy
As described in xref:boot-features:boot-features-restclient.adoc#boot-features-restclient-customization[boot-features-restclient-customization],
a `RestTemplateCustomizer` can be used with `RestTemplateBuilder` to build a customized
`RestTemplate`. This is the recommended approach for creating a `RestTemplate` configured
to use a proxy.

The exact details of the proxy configuration depend on the underlying client request
factory that is being used. Here's an example of configuring
`HttpComponentsClientRequestFactory` with an `HttpClient` that uses a proxy for all hosts
except `192.168.0.5`.
