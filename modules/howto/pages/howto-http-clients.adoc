== HTTP Clients
Spring Boot offers a number of starters that work with HTTP clients.
This section answers questions related to using them.



[[howto-http-clients-proxy-configuration]]
=== Configure RestTemplate to Use a Proxy
As described in xref:boot-features:boot-features-resttemplate.adoc#boot-features-resttemplate-customization[boot-features-resttemplate-customization], you can use a `RestTemplateCustomizer` with `RestTemplateBuilder` to build a customized `RestTemplate`.
This is the recommended approach for creating a `RestTemplate` configured to use a proxy.

The exact details of the proxy configuration depend on the underlying client request factory that is being used.
The following example configures `HttpComponentsClientRequestFactory` with an `HttpClient` that uses a proxy for all hosts except `192.168.0.5`:

[[howto-webclient-reactor-netty-customization]]
=== Configure the TcpClient used by a Reactor Netty-based WebClient
When Reactor Netty is on the classpath a Reactor Netty-based `WebClient` is auto-configured.
To customize the client's handling of network connections, provide a `ClientHttpConnector` bean.
The following example configures a 60 second connect timeout and adds a `ReadTimeoutHandler`:

TIP: Note the use of `ReactorResourceFactory` for the connection provider and event loop resources.
This ensures efficient sharing of resources for the server receiving requests and the client making requests.
