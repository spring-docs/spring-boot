= '`How-to`' guides


--
This section provides answers to some common '`how do I do that...`' type of questions
that often arise when using Spring Boot. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it
does cover quite a lot.

If you are having a specific problem that we don't cover here, you might want to check out
http://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-boot[stackoverflow.com] to see if someone has
already provided an answer; this is also a great place to ask new questions (please use
the `spring-boot` tag).

We're also more than happy to extend this section; If you want to add a '`how-to`' you
can send us a {github-code}[pull request].
