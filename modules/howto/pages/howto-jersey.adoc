=== Secure Jersey endpoints with Spring Security
Spring Security can be used to secure a Jersey-based web application in much the same
way as it can be used to secure a Spring MVC-based web application. However, if you want
to use Spring Security's method-level security with Jersey, you must configure Jersey to
use `setStatus(int)` rather `sendError(int)`. This prevents Jersey from committing the
response before Spring Security has had an opportunity to report an authentication or
authorization failure to the client.

The `jersey.config.server.response.setStatusOverSendError` must be set to `true` on the
application's `ResourceConfig` bean, as shown in the following example:
