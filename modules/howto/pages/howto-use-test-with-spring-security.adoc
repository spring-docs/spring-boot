== Testing With Spring Security
Spring Security provides support for running tests as a specific user.
For example, the test in the snippet below will run with an authenticated user that has the `ADMIN` role.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Test
	@WithMockUser(roles="ADMIN")
	public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
		mvc
			.perform(get("/"))
			...
	}
----

Spring Security provides comprehensive integration with Spring MVC Test and this can also be used when testing controllers using the `@WebMvcTest` slice and `MockMvc`.

For additional details on Spring Security's testing support, refer to Spring Security's {spring-security-docs}#test[reference documentation]).
