--
If you're just getting started with Spring Boot, or 'Spring' in general, this is the section
for you! Here we answer the basic "`what?`", "`how?`" and "`why?`" questions. You'll
find a gentle introduction to Spring Boot along with installation instructions.
We'll then build our first Spring Boot application, discussing some core principles as
we go.
