= Using Spring Boot


--
This section goes into more detail about how you should use Spring Boot. It covers topics
such as build systems, auto-configuration and how to run your applications. We also cover
some Spring Boot best practices. Although there is nothing particularly special about
Spring Boot (it is just another library that you can consume), there are a few
recommendations that, when followed, will make your development process just a
little easier.

If you're just starting out with Spring Boot, you should probably read the
_xref:getting-started:getting-started.adoc#getting-started[ Getting Started]_ guide before diving into
this section.
