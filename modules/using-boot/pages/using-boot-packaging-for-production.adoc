== Packaging your application for production
Executable jars can be used for production deployment. As they are self-contained, they
are also ideally suited for cloud-based deployment.

For additional "`production ready`" features, such as health, auditing and metric REST
or JMX end-points; consider adding `spring-boot-actuator`. See
_xref:production-ready:production-ready.adoc#production-ready[production-ready]_ for details.
