== Testing
Spring Boot provides a number of utilities and annotations to help when testing your
application. Test support is provided by two modules; `spring-boot-test` contains core
items, and `spring-boot-test-autoconfigure` supports auto-configuration for tests.

Most developers will just use the `spring-boot-starter-test` '`Starter`' which
imports both Spring Boot test modules as well has JUnit, AssertJ, Hamcrest and a number
of other useful libraries.



[[boot-features-test-scope-dependencies]]
=== Test scope dependencies
If you use the
`spring-boot-starter-test` '`Starter`' (in the `test` `scope`), you will find
the following provided libraries:

* http://junit.org[JUnit] -- The de-facto standard for unit testing Java applications.
* {spring-reference}/#integration-testing[Spring Test] & Spring Boot Test --
  Utilities and integration test support for Spring Boot applications.
* http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/[AssertJ] -- A fluent assertion library.
* http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/[Hamcrest] -- A library of matcher objects (also known
  as constraints or predicates).
* http://mockito.org/[Mockito] -- A Java mocking framework.
* https://github.com/skyscreamer/JSONassert[JSONassert] -- An assertion library for JSON.
* https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath[JsonPath] -- XPath for JSON.


[NOTE]
====
By default, Spring Boot uses Mockito 1.x. However it's also possible to use 2.x if you
wish.
====

These are common libraries that we generally find useful when writing tests. You are free
to add additional test dependencies of your own if these don't suit your needs.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-applications]]
=== Testing Spring applications
One of the major advantages of dependency injection is that it should make your code
easier to unit test. You can simply instantiate objects using the `new` operator without
even involving Spring. You can also use _mock objects_ instead of real dependencies.

Often you need to move beyond '`unit testing`' and start '`integration testing`' (with
a Spring `ApplicationContext` actually involved in the process). It's useful to be able
to perform integration testing without requiring deployment of your application or
needing to connect to other infrastructure.

The Spring Framework includes a dedicated test module for just such integration testing.
You can declare a dependency directly to `org.springframework:spring-test` or use the
`spring-boot-starter-test` '`Starter`' to pull it in transitively.

If you have not used the `spring-test` module before you should start by reading the
{spring-reference}/#testing[relevant section] of the Spring Framework reference
documentation.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications]]
=== Testing Spring Boot applications
A Spring Boot application is just a Spring `ApplicationContext`, so nothing very special
has to be done to test it beyond what you would normally do with a vanilla Spring context.
One thing to watch out for though is that the external properties, logging and other
features of Spring Boot are only installed in the context by default if you use
`SpringApplication` to create it.

Spring Boot provides a `@SpringBootTest` annotation which can be used as an
alternative to the standard `spring-test` `@ContextConfiguration` annotation when you need
Spring Boot features. The annotation works by creating the `ApplicationContext` used
in your tests via `SpringApplication`. In addition to `@SpringBootTest` a number of other
annotations are also provided for
<<boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-tests,testing more
specific slices>> of an application.

TIP: Don't forget to also add `@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)` to your test, otherwise
the annotations will be ignored.

You can use the `webEnvironment` attribute of `@SpringBootTest` to further refine
how your tests will run:

* `MOCK` -- Loads a `WebApplicationContext` and provides a mock servlet environment.
  Embedded servlet containers are not started when using this annotation. If servlet
  APIs are not on your classpath this mode will transparently fallback to creating a
  regular non-web `ApplicationContext`. Can be used in conjunction with
  `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` for `MockMvc`-based testing of your application.
* `RANDOM_PORT` -- Loads an `EmbeddedWebApplicationContext` and provides a real
  servlet environment. Embedded servlet containers are started and listening on a random
  port.
* `DEFINED_PORT` -- Loads an `EmbeddedWebApplicationContext` and provides a real
  servlet environment. Embedded servlet containers are started and listening on a defined
  port (i.e from your `application.properties` or on the default port `8080`).
* `NONE` -- Loads an `ApplicationContext` using `SpringApplication` but does not provide
  _any_ servlet environment (mock or otherwise).

NOTE: If your test is `@Transactional`, it will rollback the transaction at the end of
each test method by default. However, as using this arrangement with either `RANDOM_PORT`
or `DEFINED_PORT` implicitly provides a real servlet environment, HTTP client and
server will run in separate threads, thus separate transactions. Any transaction
initiated on the server won't rollback in this case.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-detecting-config]]
==== Detecting test configuration
If you're familiar with the Spring Test Framework, you may be used to using
`@ContextConfiguration(classes=...)` in order to specify which Spring `@Configuration`
to load. Alternatively, you might have often used nested `@Configuration` classes within
your test.

When testing Spring Boot applications this is often not required.
Spring Boot's `@*Test` annotations will search for your primary configuration
automatically whenever you don't explicitly define one.

The search algorithm works up from the package that contains the test until it finds a
`@SpringBootApplication` or `@SpringBootConfiguration` annotated class. As long as you've
<<using-boot-structuring-your-code, structured your code>> in a sensible way your main
configuration is usually found.

[NOTE]
====
If you use a
<<boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-tests, test
annotation to test a more specific slice of your application>> with such setup, you should
avoid adding configuration that are specific to a particular area on the
<<boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-user-configuration, main's
application class>>.

The underlying component scan configuration of `@SpringBootApplication` defines exclude
filters that are used to make sure slicing works as expected. If you are using an explicit
`@ComponentScan` directive on your `@SpringBootApplication`-annoted class, be aware that
those filters will be disabled. If you are using slicing, you should define them again.
====

If you want to customize the primary configuration, you can use a nested
`@TestConfiguration` class. Unlike a nested `@Configuration` class which would be used
instead of a your application's primary configuration, a nested `@TestConfiguration` class
will be used in addition to your application's primary configuration.

NOTE: Spring's test framework will cache application contexts between tests. Therefore, as
long as your tests share the same configuration (no matter how it's discovered), the
potentially time consuming process of loading the context will only happen once.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-excluding-config]]
==== Excluding test configuration
If your application uses component scanning, for example if you use
`@SpringBootApplication` or `@ComponentScan`, you may find top-level configuration classes
created only for specific tests accidentally get picked up everywhere.

As we <<boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-detecting-config,have seen above>>,
`@TestConfiguration` can be used on an inner class of a test to customize the primary
configuration. When placed on a top-level class, `@TestConfiguration` indicates that
classes in `src/test/java` should not be picked up by scanning. You can then import that
class explicitly where it is required:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@SpringBootTest
	@Import(MyTestsConfiguration.class)
	public class MyTests {

		@Test
		public void exampleTest() {
			...
		}

	}
----

NOTE: If you directly use `@ComponentScan` (i.e. not via `@SpringBootApplication`) you
will need to register the `TypeExcludeFilter` with it. See
{dc-spring-boot}/context/TypeExcludeFilter.{dc-ext}[the Javadoc] for details.




[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-working-with-random-ports]]
==== Working with random ports
If you need to start a full running server for tests, we recommend that you use random
ports. If you use `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)`
an available port will be picked at random each time your test runs.

The `@LocalServerPort` annotation can be used to
<<howto-discover-the-http-port-at-runtime,inject the actual port used>> into your test.
For convenience, tests that need to make REST calls to the started server can additionally
`@Autowire` a `TestRestTemplate` which will resolve relative links to the running server.

include::{code-examples}/test/web/RandomPortExampleTests.java[tag=test-random-port]
----



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-jmx]]
==== Using JMX
As the test context framework caches context, JMX is disabled by default to prevent
identical components to register on the same domain. If such test needs access to an
`MBeanServer`, consider marking it dirty as well:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{test-examples}/jmx/SampleJmxTests.java[tag=test]
----



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-mocking-beans]]
==== Mocking and spying beans
It's sometimes necessary to mock certain components within your application context when
running tests. For example, you may have a facade over some remote service that's
unavailable during development. Mocking can also be useful when you want to simulate
failures that might be hard to trigger in a real environment.

Spring Boot includes a `@MockBean` annotation that can be used to define a Mockito mock
for a bean inside your `ApplicationContext`. You can use the annotation to add new beans,
or replace a single existing bean definition. The annotation can be used directly on test
classes, on fields within your test, or on `@Configuration` classes and fields. When used
on a field, the instance of the created mock will also be injected. Mock beans are
automatically reset after each test method.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is automatically enabled as long as your test uses one of Spring Boot's
test annotations (i.e. `@SpringBootTest`). To use this feature with a different
arrangement, a listener will need to be added explicitly:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@TestExecutionListeners(MockitoTestExecutionListener.class)
----

====

Here's a typical example where we replace an existing `RemoteService` bean with a mock
implementation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.junit.*;
	import org.junit.runner.*;
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.context.*;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.*;
	import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.*;

	import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;
	import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.*;

	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@SpringBootTest
	public class MyTests {

		@MockBean
		private RemoteService remoteService;

		@Autowired
		private Reverser reverser;

		@Test
		public void exampleTest() {
			// RemoteService has been injected into the reverser bean
			given(this.remoteService.someCall()).willReturn("mock");
			String reverse = reverser.reverseSomeCall();
			assertThat(reverse).isEqualTo("kcom");
		}

	}
----

Additionally you can also use `@SpyBean` to wrap any existing bean with a Mockito `spy`.
See the Javadoc for full details.


[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-tests]]
==== Auto-configured tests
Spring Boot's auto-configuration system works well for applications, but can sometimes be
a little too much for tests. It's often helpful to load only the parts of the
configuration that are required to test a '`slice`' of your application. For example, you
might want to test that Spring MVC controllers are mapping URLs correctly, and you don't
want to involve database calls in those tests; or you _might be wanting_ to test JPA
entities, and you're not interested in web layer when those tests run.

The `spring-boot-test-autoconfigure` module includes a number of annotations that can be
used to automatically configure such '`slices`'. Each of them works in a similar way,
providing a `@...Test` annotation that loads the `ApplicationContext` and one or
more `@AutoConfigure...` annotations that can be used to customize auto-configuration
settings.

NOTE: Each slice loads a very restricted set of auto-configuration classes. If you need to
exclude one of them, most `@...Test` annotations provide an `excludeAutoConfiguration`
attribute. Alternatively, you can use `@ImportAutoConfiguration#exclude`.

TIP: It's also possible to use the `@AutoConfigure...` annotations with the standard
`@SpringBootTest` annotation. You can use this combination if you're not interested
 in '`slicing`' your application but you want some of the auto-configured test beans.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-json-tests]]
==== Auto-configured JSON tests
To test that Object JSON serialization and deserialization is working as expected you can
use the `@JsonTest` annotation. `@JsonTest` will auto-configure Jackson `ObjectMapper`,
any `@JsonComponent` beans and any Jackson `Modules`. It also configures `Gson`
if you happen to be using that instead of, or as well as, Jackson. If you need to
configure elements of the auto-configuration you can use the `@AutoConfigureJsonTesters`
annotation.

Spring Boot includes AssertJ based helpers that work with the JSONassert and JsonPath
libraries to check that JSON is as expected. The `JacksonTester`, `GsonTester` and
`BasicJsonTester` classes can be used for Jackson, Gson and Strings respectively. Any
helper fields on the test class can be `@Autowired` when using `@JsonTest`.

	import org.springframework.boot.test.context.*;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.json.*;
	import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.*;

	import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;

	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@JsonTest
	public class MyJsonTests {

		@Autowired
		private JacksonTester<VehicleDetails> json;

		@Test
		public void testSerialize() throws Exception {
			VehicleDetails details = new VehicleDetails("Honda", "Civic");
			// Assert against a `.json` file in the same package as the test
			assertThat(this.json.write(details)).isEqualToJson("expected.json");
			// Or use JSON path based assertions
			assertThat(this.json.write(details)).hasJsonPathStringValue("@.make");
			assertThat(this.json.write(details)).extractingJsonPathStringValue("@.make")
					.isEqualTo("Honda");
		}

		@Test
		public void testDeserialize() throws Exception {
			String content = "{\"make\":\"Ford\",\"model\":\"Focus\"}";
			assertThat(this.json.parse(content))
					.isEqualTo(new VehicleDetails("Ford", "Focus"));
			assertThat(this.json.parseObject(content).getMake()).isEqualTo("Ford");
		}

	}
----


NOTE: JSON helper classes can also be used directly in standard unit tests. Simply
call the `initFields` method of the helper in your `@Before` method if you aren't using
`@JsonTest`.

A list of the auto-configuration that is enabled by `@JsonTest` can be
<<appendix-test-auto-configuration#test-auto-configuration,found in the appendix>>.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-mvc-tests]]
==== Auto-configured Spring MVC tests
To test Spring MVC controllers are working as expected you can use the `@WebMvcTest`
annotation. `@WebMvcTest` will auto-configure the Spring MVC infrastructure and limit
scanned beans to `@Controller`, `@ControllerAdvice`, `@JsonComponent`, `Filter`,
`WebMvcConfigurer` and `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver`. Regular `@Component` beans
will not be scanned when using this annotation.

Often `@WebMvcTest` will be limited to a single controller and used in combination with
`@MockBean` to provide mock implementations for required collaborators.

`@WebMvcTest` also auto-configures `MockMvc`. Mock MVC offers a powerful way to quickly
test MVC controllers without needing to start a full HTTP server.

TIP: You can also auto-configure `MockMvc` in a non-`@WebMvcTest` (e.g. `SpringBootTest`)
by annotating it with `@AutoConfigureMockMvc`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.junit.*;
	import org.junit.runner.*;
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.*;

	public class MyControllerTests {

		@Autowired
		private MockMvc mvc;

		@MockBean
		private UserVehicleService userVehicleService;

		@Test
		public void testExample() throws Exception {
			given(this.userVehicleService.getVehicleDetails("sboot"))
					.willReturn(new VehicleDetails("Honda", "Civic"));
			this.mvc.perform(get("/sboot/vehicle").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN))
					.andExpect(status().isOk()).andExpect(content().string("Honda Civic"));
		}

	}
----

TIP: If you need to configure elements of the auto-configuration (for example when servlet
filters should be applied) you can use attributes in the `@AutoConfigureMockMvc`
annotation.

If you use HtmlUnit or Selenium, auto-configuration will also provide a `WebClient` bean
and/or a `WebDriver` bean. Here is an example that uses HtmlUnit:


[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.*;
	import org.junit.*;
	import org.junit.runner.*;
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.*;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.*;

	import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;
	import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.*;

	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@WebMvcTest(UserVehicleController.class)
	public class MyHtmlUnitTests {

		@Autowired
		private WebClient webClient;

		@MockBean
		private UserVehicleService userVehicleService;

		@Test
		public void testExample() throws Exception {
			given(this.userVehicleService.getVehicleDetails("sboot"))
					.willReturn(new VehicleDetails("Honda", "Civic"));
			HtmlPage page = this.webClient.getPage("/sboot/vehicle.html");
			assertThat(page.getBody().getTextContent()).isEqualTo("Honda Civic");
		}

	}
----

NOTE: By default Spring Boot will put `WebDriver` beans in a special "`scope`" to ensure
that the driver is quit after each test, and that a new instance is injected. If you don't
want this behavior you can add `@Scope("singleton")` to your `WebDriver` `@Bean`
definition.

A list of the auto-configuration that is enabled by `@WebMvcTest` can be
<<appendix-test-auto-configuration#test-auto-configuration,found in the appendix>>.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-jpa-test]]
==== Auto-configured Data JPA tests
`@DataJpaTest` can be used if you want to test JPA applications. By default it will
configure an in-memory embedded database, scan for `@Entity` classes and configure Spring
Data JPA repositories. Regular `@Component` beans will not be loaded into the
`ApplicationContext`.

Data JPA tests are transactional and rollback at the end of each test by default,
see the {spring-reference}#testcontext-tx-enabling-transactions[relevant section] in the
Spring Reference Documentation for more details. If that's not what you want, you can
disable transaction management for a test or for the whole class as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.junit.Test;
	import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.DataJpaTest;
	import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
	import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Propagation;
	import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@DataJpaTest
	@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)
	public class ExampleNonTransactionalTests {

	}
----

Data JPA tests may also inject a
{sc-spring-boot-test-autoconfigure}/orm/jpa/TestEntityManager.{sc-ext}[`TestEntityManager`]
bean which provides an alternative to the standard JPA `EntityManager` specifically
designed for tests. If you want to use `TestEntityManager` outside of `@DataJpaTests` you
can also use the `@AutoConfigureTestEntityManager` annotation. A `JdbcTemplate` is also
available if you need that.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.junit.*;
	import org.junit.runner.*;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.*;

	import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;

	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@DataJpaTest
	public class ExampleRepositoryTests {

		@Autowired
		private TestEntityManager entityManager;

		@Autowired
		private UserRepository repository;

		@Test
		public void testExample() throws Exception {
			this.entityManager.persist(new User("sboot", "1234"));
			User user = this.repository.findByUsername("sboot");
			assertThat(user.getUsername()).isEqualTo("sboot");
			assertThat(user.getVin()).isEqualTo("1234");
		}

	}
----

In-memory embedded databases generally work well for tests since they are fast and don't
require any developer installation. If, however, you prefer to run tests against a real
database you can use the `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase` annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@DataJpaTest
	@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace=Replace.NONE)
	public class ExampleRepositoryTests {

		// ...

	}
----

<<appendix-test-auto-configuration#test-auto-configuration,found in the appendix>>.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-jdbc-test]]
==== Auto-configured JDBC tests
`@JdbcTest` is similar to `@DataJpaTest` but for pure jdbc-related tests. By default it
will also configure an in-memory embedded database and a `JdbcTemplate`. Regular
`@Component` beans will not be loaded into the `ApplicationContext`.

JDBC tests are transactional and rollback at the end of each test by default,
see the {spring-reference}#testcontext-tx-enabling-transactions[relevant section] in the
Spring Reference Documentation for more details. If that's not what you want, you can
disable transaction management for a test or for the whole class as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.junit.Test;
	import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.jdbc.JdbcTest;

	import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@JdbcTest
	@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)
	public class ExampleNonTransactionalTests {

	}
----

If you prefer your test to run against a real database, you can use the
`@AutoConfigureTestDatabase` annotation the same way as for `DataJpaTest`.

<<appendix-test-auto-configuration#test-auto-configuration,found in the appendix>>.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-mongo-test]]
==== Auto-configured Data MongoDB tests
`@DataMongoTest` can be used if you want to test MongoDB applications. By default, it will
configure an in-memory embedded MongoDB (if available), configure a `MongoTemplate`, scan
for `@Document` classes and configure Spring Data MongoDB repositories. Regular
`@Component` beans will not be loaded into the `ApplicationContext`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.mongo.DataMongoTest;

	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@DataMongoTest
	public class ExampleDataMongoTests {

		@Autowired
		private MongoTemplate mongoTemplate;

		//
	}
----

In-memory embedded MongoDB generally works well for tests since it is fast and doesn't
require any developer installation. If, however, you prefer to run tests against a real
MongoDB server you should exclude the embedded MongoDB auto-configuration:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.mongo.embedded.EmbeddedMongoAutoConfiguration;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.mongo.DataMongoTest;

[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-rest-client]]
==== Auto-configured REST clients
The `@RestClientTest` annotation can be used if you want to test REST clients. By default
it will auto-configure Jackson and GSON support, configure a `RestTemplateBuilder` and
add support for `MockRestServiceServer`. The specific beans that you want to test should
be specified using `value` or `components` attribute of `@RestClientTest`:


[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@RestClientTest(RemoteVehicleDetailsService.class)
	public class ExampleRestClientTest {

		@Autowired
		private RemoteVehicleDetailsService service;

		@Test
		public void getVehicleDetailsWhenResultIsSuccessShouldReturnDetails()
				throws Exception {
			this.server.expect(requestTo("/greet/details"))
					.andRespond(withSuccess("hello", MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN));
			String greeting = this.service.callRestService();
			assertThat(greeting).isEqualTo("hello");
		}

	}
----

<<appendix-test-auto-configuration#test-auto-configuration,found in the appendix>>.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-rest-docs]]
==== Auto-configured Spring REST Docs tests
The `@AutoConfigureRestDocs` annotation can be used if you want to use Spring REST Docs
in your tests. It will automatically configure `MockMvc` to use Spring REST Docs and
remove the need for Spring REST Docs' JUnit rule.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.junit.Test;
	import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcTest;
	import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
	import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
	import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;

	import static org.springframework.restdocs.mockmvc.MockMvcRestDocumentation.document;
	import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.get;
	import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.*;

	@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
	@WebMvcTest(UserController.class)
	@AutoConfigureRestDocs("target/generated-snippets")
	public class UserDocumentationTests {

		@Autowired
		private MockMvc mvc;

		@Test
		public void listUsers() throws Exception {
			this.mvc.perform(get("/users").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN))
					.andExpect(status().isOk())
					.andDo(document("list-users"));
		}

	}
----

In addition to configuring the output directory, `@AutoConfigureRestDocs` can also
configure the host, scheme, and port that will appear in any documented URIs. If you
require more control over Spring REST Docs' configuration a
`RestDocsMockMvcConfigurationCustomizer` bean can be used:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@TestConfiguration
	static class CustomizationConfiguration
			implements RestDocsMockMvcConfigurationCustomizer {

		@Override
		public void customize(MockMvcRestDocumentationConfigurer configurer) {
			configurer.snippets().withTemplateFormat(TemplateFormats.markdown());
		}

	}
----

If you want to make use of Spring REST Docs' support for a parameterized output directory,
you can create a `RestDocumentationResultHandler` bean. The auto-configuration will
call `alwaysDo` with this result handler, thereby causing each `MockMvc` call to
automatically generate the default snippets:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@TestConfiguration
	static class ResultHandlerConfiguration {

		@Bean
		public RestDocumentationResultHandler restDocumentation() {
			return MockMvcRestDocumentation.document("{method-name}");
		}

	}
----



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-user-configuration]]
==== User configuration and slicing
If you've <<using-boot-structuring-your-code, structured your code>> in a sensible way,
your `@SpringBootApplication` class is
<<boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-detecting-config, used by default>> as
the configuration of your tests.

It then becomes important not to litter the application's main class with configuration
that are are specific to a particular area of its functionality.

Let's assume that you are using Spring Batch and you're relying on the auto-configuration
for it. Your could define your `@SpringBootApplication` as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@SpringBootApplication
	@EnableBatchProcessing
	public class SampleApplication { ... }
----

Because this class is the source configuration for the test, any slice test will actually
attempt to start Spring Batch, which is definitely not what you want to do. A recommended
approach is to move that area-specific configuration to a separate `@Configuration`
class at the same level as your application.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableBatchProcessing
	public class BatchConfiguration { ... }
----

NOTE: Depending on the surface area of your application, you may either have a single
`ApplicationConfiguration` class for your customizations or one class per domain area
when it makes sense. The latter approach allows you to enable it in one of your test
if necessary via `@Import`.

Another source of confusion is classpath scanning. Let's assume that, while you've
structured your code in a sensible way, you need to scan an additional package. Your
application may look like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@SpringBootApplication
	@ComponentScan({ "com.example.app", "org.acme.another" })
	public class SampleApplication { ... }
----

This effectively overrides the default component scan directive with the side effect of
scanning those two packages regardless of the slice that you've chosen. For instance a
`@DataJpaTest` will all of a sudden scan components and user configurations of your
application. Again, moving the custom directive to a separate class is a good way to fix
this issue.

TIP: If this is not an option for you, you can create a `@SpringBootConfiguration`
somewhere in the hierarchy of your test so that it is used instead. Or you can specify
a source for your test which will disable the behaviour of finding a default one.



[[boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-with-spock]]
==== Using Spock to test Spring Boot applications
If you wish to use Spock to test a Spring Boot application you should add a dependency
on Spock's `spock-spring` module to your application's build. `spock-spring` integrates
Spring's test framework into Spock. Exactly how you can use Spock to test a Spring Boot
application depends on the version of Spock that you are using.

NOTE: Spring Boot provides dependency management for Spock 1.0. If you wish to use Spock
1.1 you should <<howto.adoc#howto-customize-dependency-versions,override the
`spock.version` property>> in your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` file.

When using Spock 1.1, the annotations <<boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications,
described above>> can be used and you can annotate your `Specification` with
`@SpringBootTest` to suit the needs of your tests. When using Spock 1.0, `@SpringBootTest`
will not work for a web project. If you wish to use Spock to test a web project, you
should use Spock 1.1 by overriding the `spock.version` property as described above.



[[boot-features-test-utilities]]
=== Test utilities
A few test utility classes are packaged as part of `spring-boot` that are generally
useful when testing your application.



[[boot-features-configfileapplicationcontextinitializer-test-utility]]
==== ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer
`ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer` is an `ApplicationContextInitializer` that
can apply to your tests to load Spring Boot `application.properties` files. You can use
this when you don't need the full features provided by `@SpringBootTest`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config.class,
		initializers = ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer.class)
----

NOTE: Using `ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer` alone won't provide support for
`@Value("${...}")` injection. Its only job is to ensure that `application.properties` files
are loaded into Spring's `Environment`. For `@Value` support you need to either
additionally configure a `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` or use `@SpringBootTest`
where one will be auto-configured for you.



[[boot-features-environment-test-utilities]]
==== EnvironmentTestUtils
`EnvironmentTestUtils` allows you to quickly add properties to a
`ConfigurableEnvironment` or `ConfigurableApplicationContext`. Simply call it with
`key=value` strings:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	EnvironmentTestUtils.addEnvironment(env, "org=Spring", "name=Boot");
----



[[boot-features-output-capture-test-utility]]
==== OutputCapture
`OutputCapture` is a JUnit `Rule` that you can use to capture `System.out` and
`System.err` output. Simply declare the capture as a `@Rule` then use `toString()`
for assertions:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.junit.Rule;
	import org.junit.Test;
	import org.springframework.boot.test.rule.OutputCapture;

	import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;
	import static org.junit.Assert.*;

	public class MyTest {

		@Rule
		public OutputCapture capture = new OutputCapture();

		@Test
		public void testName() throws Exception {
			System.out.println("Hello World!");
			assertThat(capture.toString(), containsString("World"));
		}

	}
----

[[boot-features-rest-templates-test-utility]]
==== TestRestTemplate
`TestRestTemplate` is a convenience alternative to Spring's `RestTemplate` that is useful
in integration tests. You can get a vanilla template or one that sends Basic HTTP
authentication (with a username and password). In either case the template will behave
in a test-friendly way by not throwing exceptions on server-side errors. It is
recommended, but not mandatory, to use Apache HTTP Client (version 4.3.2 or better), and
if you have that on your classpath the `TestRestTemplate` will respond by configuring
the client appropriately. If you do use Apache's HTTP client some additional test-friendly
features will be enabled:

* Redirects will not be followed (so you can assert the response location)
* Cookies will be ignored (so the template is stateless)

`TestRestTemplate` can be instantiated directly in your integration tests:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	public class MyTest {

		private TestRestTemplate template = new TestRestTemplate();

		@Test
		public void testRequest() throws Exception {
			HttpHeaders headers = this.template.getForEntity(
					"http://myhost.example.com/example", String.class).getHeaders();
			assertThat(headers.getLocation()).hasHost("other.example.com");
		}

	}
----

Alternatively, if you are using the `@SpringBootTest` annotation with
`WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT` or `WebEnvironment.DEFINED_PORT`, you can just inject a
fully configured `TestRestTemplate` and start using it. If necessary, additional
customizations can be applied via the `RestTemplateBuilder` bean. Any URLs that do not
specify a host and port will automatically connect to the embedded server:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{test-examples}/web/client/SampleWebClientTests.java[tag=test]
