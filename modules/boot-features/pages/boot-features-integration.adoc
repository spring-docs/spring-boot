== Spring Integration
Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with {spring-integration}[Spring Integration], including the `spring-boot-starter-integration` "`Starter`".
Spring Integration provides abstractions over messaging and also other transports such as HTTP, TCP, and others.
If Spring Integration is available on your classpath, it is initialized through the `@EnableIntegration` annotation.

Spring Boot also configures some features that are triggered by the presence of additional Spring Integration modules.
If `spring-integration-jmx` is also on the classpath, message processing statistics are published over JMX.
If `spring-integration-jdbc` is available, the default database schema can be created on startup, as shown in the following line:

[source,properties,indent=0,configprops]
----
	spring.integration.jdbc.initialize-schema=always
----

See the {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/integration/IntegrationAutoConfiguration.java[`IntegrationAutoConfiguration`] and {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/integration/IntegrationProperties.java[`IntegrationProperties`] classes for more details.

By default, if a Micrometer `meterRegistry` bean is present, Spring Integration metrics will be managed by Micrometer.
If you wish to use legacy Spring Integration metrics, add a `DefaultMetricsFactory` bean to the application context.
