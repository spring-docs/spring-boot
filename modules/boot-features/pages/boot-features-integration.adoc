== Spring Integration
Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with Spring Integration, including
the `spring-boot-starter-integration` '`Starter`'. Spring Integration provides
abstractions over messaging and also other transports such as HTTP, TCP etc. If Spring
Integration is available on your classpath it will be initialized through the
`@EnableIntegration` annotation. Message processing statistics will be published over JMX
if `'spring-integration-jmx'` is also on the classpath. See the
{sc-spring-boot-autoconfigure}/integration/IntegrationAutoConfiguration.{sc-ext}[`IntegrationAutoConfiguration`]
class for more details.
