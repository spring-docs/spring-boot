== Validation
The method validation feature supported by Bean Validation 1.1 is automatically enabled
as long as a JSR-303 implementation (e.g. Hibernate validator) is on the classpath. This
allows bean methods to be annotated with `javax.validation` constraints on their
parameters and/or on their return value. Target classes with such annotated methods need
to be annotated with the `@Validated` annotation at the type level for their methods to
be searched for inline constraint annotations.

For instance, the following service triggers the validation of the first argument, making
sure its size is between 8 and 10
