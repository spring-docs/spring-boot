[[boot-features-sql]]
== Working with SQL databases
The Spring Framework provides extensive support for working with SQL databases. From
direct JDBC access using `JdbcTemplate` to complete '`object relational mapping`'
technologies such as Hibernate. Spring Data provides an additional level of functionality,
creating `Repository` implementations directly from interfaces and using conventions to
generate queries from your method names.



[[boot-features-configure-datasource]]
=== Configure a DataSource
Java's `javax.sql.DataSource` interface provides a standard method of working with
database connections. Traditionally a DataSource uses a `URL` along with some
credentials to establish a database connection.

TIP: Check also xref:howto:howto-data-access.adoc#howto-configure-a-datasource[the '`How-to`' section] for more
advanced examples, typically to take full control over the configuration of the
DataSource.



[[boot-features-embedded-database-support]]
==== Embedded Database Support
It's often convenient to develop applications using an in-memory embedded database.
Obviously, in-memory databases do not provide persistent storage; you will need to
populate your database when your application starts and be prepared to throw away
data when your application ends.

TIP: The '`How-to`' section includes a _<<howto.adoc#howto-database-initialization,
section on how to initialize a database>>_

Spring Boot can auto-configure embedded http://www.h2database.com[H2],
http://hsqldb.org/[HSQL] and http://db.apache.org/derby/[Derby] databases. You don't need
to provide any connection URLs, simply include a build dependency to the embedded database
that you want to use.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using this feature in your tests, you may notice that the same database is
reused by your whole test suite regardless of the number of application contexts that
you use. If you want to make sure that each context has a separate embedded database,
you should set `spring.datasource.generate-unique-name` to `true`.
====

For example, typical POM dependencies would be:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.hsqldb</groupId>
		<artifactId>hsqldb</artifactId>
		<scope>runtime</scope>
	</dependency>
----

NOTE: You need a dependency on `spring-jdbc` for an embedded database to be
auto-configured. In this example it's pulled in transitively via
`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`.

TIP: If, for whatever reason, you do configure the connection URL for an embedded
database, care should be taken to ensure that the databaseâ€™s automatic shutdown is
disabled. If you're using H2 you should use `DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE` to do so. If you're
using HSQLDB, you should ensure that `shutdown=true` is not used. Disabling the database's
automatic shutdown allows Spring Boot to control when the database is closed, thereby
ensuring that it happens once access to the database is no longer needed.



[[boot-features-connect-to-production-database]]
==== Connection to a production database
Production database connections can also be auto-configured using a pooling `DataSource`.
Here's the algorithm for choosing a specific implementation:

* We prefer the Tomcat pooling `DataSource` for its performance and concurrency, so if
  that is available we always choose it.
* Otherwise, if HikariCP is available we will use it.
* If neither the Tomcat pooling datasource nor HikariCP are available and if Commons DBCP
  is available we will use it, but we don't recommend it in production and its support
  is deprecated.
* Lastly, if Commons DBCP2 is available we will use it.

If you use the `spring-boot-starter-jdbc` or `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`
'`starters`' you will automatically get a dependency to `tomcat-jdbc`.

NOTE: You can bypass that algorithm completely and specify the connection pool to use via
the `spring.datasource.type` property. This is especially important if you are running
your application in a Tomcat container as `tomcat-jdbc` is provided by default.

TIP: Additional connection pools can always be configured manually. If you define your
own `DataSource` bean, auto-configuration will not occur.

DataSource configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in
`+spring.datasource.*+`. For example, you might declare the following section in
`application.properties`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
	spring.datasource.username=dbuser
	spring.datasource.password=dbpass
	spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
----

NOTE: You should at least specify the url using the `spring.datasource.url` property or
Spring Boot will attempt to auto-configure an embedded database.

TIP: You often won't need to specify the `driver-class-name` since Spring boot can deduce
it for most databases from the `url`.

NOTE: For a pooling `DataSource` to be created we need to be able to verify that a valid
`Driver` class is available, so we check for that before doing anything. I.e. if you set
`spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver` then that class has to be
loadable.

See {sc-spring-boot-autoconfigure}/jdbc/DataSourceProperties.{sc-ext}[`DataSourceProperties`]
for more of the supported options. These are the standard options that work regardless of
the actual implementation. It is also possible to fine-tune implementation-specific
settings using their respective prefix (`+spring.datasource.tomcat.*+`,
`+spring.datasource.hikari.*+`, and `+spring.datasource.dbcp2.*+`). Refer to the
documentation of the connection pool implementation you are using for more details.

For instance, if you are using the
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html#Common_Attributes[Tomcat connection pool]
you could customize many additional settings:


[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	# Number of ms to wait before throwing an exception if no connection is available.
	spring.datasource.tomcat.max-wait=10000

	# Maximum number of active connections that can be allocated from this pool at the same time.
	spring.datasource.tomcat.max-active=50

	# Validate the connection before borrowing it from the pool.
	spring.datasource.tomcat.test-on-borrow=true
----



[[boot-features-connecting-to-a-jndi-datasource]]
==== Connection to a JNDI DataSource
If you are deploying your Spring Boot application to an Application Server you might want
to configure and manage your DataSource using your Application Servers built-in features
and access it using JNDI.

The `spring.datasource.jndi-name` property can be used as an alternative to the
`spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password`
properties to access the `DataSource` from a specific JNDI location. For example, the
following section in `application.properties` shows how you can access a JBoss AS defined
`DataSource`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.datasource.jndi-name=java:jboss/datasources/customers
----



[[boot-features-using-jdbc-template]]
=== Using JdbcTemplate
Spring's `JdbcTemplate` and `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` classes are auto-configured and
you can `@Autowire` them directly into your own beans:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
	import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
	import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

	@Component
	public class MyBean {

		private final JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

		@Autowired
		public MyBean(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
			this.jdbcTemplate = jdbcTemplate;
		}

		// ...

	}
----



[[boot-features-jpa-and-spring-data]]
=== JPA and '`Spring Data`'
The Java Persistence API is a standard technology that allows you to '`map`' objects to
relational databases. The `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` POM provides a quick way to get
started. It provides the following key dependencies:

* Hibernate -- One of the most popular JPA implementations.
* Spring Data JPA -- Makes it easy to implement JPA-based repositories.
* Spring ORMs -- Core ORM support from the Spring Framework.

TIP: We won't go into too many details of JPA or Spring Data here. You can follow the
http://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/['`Accessing Data with JPA`'] guide from
http://spring.io and read the http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/[Spring Data JPA]
and  http://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/[Hibernate] reference documentation.


[NOTE]
====
By default, Spring Boot uses Hibernate 5.0.x. However it's also possible to use 4.3.x
or 5.2.x if you wish. Please refer to the
{github-code}/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-hibernate4[Hibernate 4] and
{github-code}/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-hibernate52[Hibernate 5.2] samples
to see how to do so.
====


[[boot-features-entity-classes]]
==== Entity Classes
Traditionally, JPA '`Entity`' classes are specified in a `persistence.xml` file. With
Spring Boot this file is not necessary and instead '`Entity Scanning`' is used. By default
all packages below your main configuration class (the one annotated with
`@EnableAutoConfiguration` or `@SpringBootApplication`) will be searched.

Any classes annotated with `@Entity`, `@Embeddable` or `@MappedSuperclass` will be
considered. A typical entity class would look something like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	package com.example.myapp.domain;

	import java.io.Serializable;
	import javax.persistence.*;

	@Entity
	public class City implements Serializable {

		@Id
		@GeneratedValue
		private Long id;

		@Column(nullable = false)
		private String name;

		@Column(nullable = false)
		private String state;

		// ... additional members, often include @OneToMany mappings

		protected City() {
			// no-args constructor required by JPA spec
			// this one is protected since it shouldn't be used directly
		}

		public City(String name, String state) {
			this.name = name;
			this.country = country;
		}

		public String getName() {
			return this.name;
		}

		public String getState() {
			return this.state;
		}

		// ... etc

	}
----

TIP: You can customize entity scanning locations using the `@EntityScan` annotation. See
the _xref:howto:howto-data-access.adoc#howto-separate-entity-definitions-from-spring-configuration[howto-separate-entity-definitions-from-spring-configuration]_ how-to.



[[boot-features-spring-data-jpa-repositories]]
==== Spring Data JPA Repositories
Spring Data JPA repositories are interfaces that you can define to access data. JPA
queries are created automatically from your method names. For example, a `CityRepository`
interface might declare a `findAllByState(String state)` method to find all cities in a
given state.

For more complex queries you can annotate your method using Spring Data's
{spring-data-javadoc}/repository/Query.html[`Query`] annotation.

Spring Data repositories usually extend from the
{spring-data-commons-javadoc}/repository/Repository.html[`Repository`] or
{spring-data-commons-javadoc}/repository/CrudRepository.html[`CrudRepository`] interfaces.
If you are using auto-configuration, repositories will be searched from the package
containing your main configuration class (the one annotated with
`@EnableAutoConfiguration` or `@SpringBootApplication`) down.

Here is a typical Spring Data repository:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	package com.example.myapp.domain;

	import org.springframework.data.domain.*;
	import org.springframework.data.repository.*;

	public interface CityRepository extends Repository<City, Long> {

		Page<City> findAll(Pageable pageable);

		City findByNameAndCountryAllIgnoringCase(String name, String country);

	}
----

TIP: We have barely scratched the surface of Spring Data JPA. For complete details check
their http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/[reference documentation].



[[boot-features-creating-and-dropping-jpa-databases]]
==== Creating and dropping JPA databases
By default, JPA databases will be automatically created *only* if you use an embedded
database (H2, HSQL or Derby). You can explicitly configure JPA settings using
`+spring.jpa.*+` properties. For example, to create and drop tables you can add the
following to your `application.properties`.

[indent=0]
----
	spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
----

NOTE: Hibernate's own internal property name for this (if you happen to remember it
better) is `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto`. You can set it, along with other Hibernate native
properties, using `+spring.jpa.properties.*+` (the prefix is stripped before adding them
to the entity manager). Example:

[indent=0]
----
	spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.globally_quoted_identifiers=true
----

passes `hibernate.globally_quoted_identifiers` to the Hibernate entity manager.

By default the DDL execution (or validation) is deferred until the `ApplicationContext`
has started. There is also a `spring.jpa.generate-ddl` flag, but it is not used if
Hibernate autoconfig is active because the `ddl-auto` settings are more fine-grained.



[[boot-features-jpa-in-web-environment]]
==== Open EntityManager in View
If you are running a web application, Spring Boot will by default register
{spring-javadoc}/orm/jpa/support/OpenEntityManagerInViewInterceptor.html[`OpenEntityManagerInViewInterceptor`]
to apply the "Open EntityManager in View" pattern, i.e. to allow for lazy loading in web
views. If you don't want this behavior you should set `spring.jpa.open-in-view` to
`false` in your `application.properties`.



[[boot-features-sql-h2-console]]
=== Using H2's web console
The http://www.h2database.com[H2 database] provides a
http://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html#h2_console[browser-based console] that
Spring Boot can auto-configure for you. The console will be auto-configured when the
following conditions are met:

* You are developing a web application
* `com.h2database:h2` is on the classpath
* You are using <<using-spring-boot.adoc#using-boot-devtools,Spring Boot's developer
  tools>>

TIP: If you are not using Spring Boot's developer tools, but would still like to make use
of H2's console, then you can do so by configuring the `spring.h2.console.enabled`
property with a value of `true`. The H2 console is only intended for use during
development so care should be taken to ensure that `spring.h2.console.enabled` is not set
to `true` in production.



[[boot-features-sql-h2-console-custom-path]]
==== Changing the H2 console's path
By default the console will be available at `/h2-console`. You can customize the console's
path using the `spring.h2.console.path` property.



[[boot-features-sql-h2-console-securing]]
==== Securing the H2 console
When Spring Security is on the classpath and basic auth is enabled, the H2 console will be
automatically secured using basic auth. The following properties can be used to customize
the security configuration:

* `security.user.role`
* `security.basic.authorize-mode`
* `security.basic.enabled`



[[boot-features-jooq]]
=== Using jOOQ
Java Object Oriented Querying (http://www.jooq.org/[jOOQ]) is a popular product from
http://www.datageekery.com/[Data Geekery] which generates Java code from your
database, and lets you build type safe SQL queries through its fluent API. Both the
commercial and open source editions can be used with Spring Boot.



==== Code Generation
In order to use jOOQ type-safe queries, you need to generate Java classes from your
database schema. You can follow the instructions in the
{jooq-manual}/#jooq-in-7-steps-step3[jOOQ user manual]. If you are using the
`jooq-codegen-maven` plugin (and you also use the `spring-boot-starter-parent`
"`parent POM`") you can safely omit the plugin's `<version>` tag. You can also use Spring
Boot defined version variables (e.g. `h2.version`) to declare the plugin's database
dependency. Here's an example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<plugin>
		<groupId>org.jooq</groupId>
		<artifactId>jooq-codegen-maven</artifactId>
		<executions>
			...
		</executions>
		<dependencies>
			<dependency>
				<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
				<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
				<version>${h2.version}</version>
			</dependency>
		</dependencies>
		<configuration>
			<jdbc>
				<driver>org.h2.Driver</driver>
				<url>jdbc:h2:~/yourdatabase</url>
			</jdbc>
			<generator>
				...
			</generator>
		</configuration>
	</plugin>
----



==== Using DSLContext
The fluent API offered by jOOQ is initiated via the `org.jooq.DSLContext` interface.
Spring Boot will auto-configure a `DSLContext` as a Spring Bean and connect it to your
application `DataSource`. To use the `DSLContext` you can just `@Autowire` it:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Component
	public class JooqExample implements CommandLineRunner {

		private final DSLContext create;

		@Autowired
		public JooqExample(DSLContext dslContext) {
			this.create = dslContext;
		}

	}
----

TIP: The jOOQ manual tends to use a variable named `create` to hold the `DSLContext`,
we've done the same for this example.

You can then use the `DSLContext` to construct your queries:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	public List<GregorianCalendar> authorsBornAfter1980() {
		return this.create.selectFrom(AUTHOR)
			.where(AUTHOR.DATE_OF_BIRTH.greaterThan(new GregorianCalendar(1980, 0, 1)))
			.fetch(AUTHOR.DATE_OF_BIRTH);
	}
----



==== Customizing jOOQ
You can customize the SQL dialect used by jOOQ by setting `spring.jooq.sql-dialect` in
your `application.properties`. For example, to specify Postgres you would add:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.jooq.sql-dialect=Postgres
----

More advanced customizations can be achieved by defining your own `@Bean` definitions
which will be used when the jOOQ `Configuration` is created. You can define beans for
the following jOOQ Types:

* `ConnectionProvider`
* `TransactionProvider`
* `RecordMapperProvider`
* `RecordListenerProvider`
* `ExecuteListenerProvider`
* `VisitListenerProvider`

You can also create your own `org.jooq.Configuration` `@Bean` if you want to take
complete control of the jOOQ configuration.
