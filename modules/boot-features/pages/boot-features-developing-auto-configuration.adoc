[[boot-features-developing-auto-configuration]]
== Creating your own auto-configuration
If you work in a company that develops shared libraries, or if you work on an open-source
or commercial library, you might want to develop your own auto-configuration.
Auto-configuration classes can be bundled in external jars and still be picked-up by
Spring Boot.

Auto-configuration can be associated to a "starter" that provides the auto-configuration
code as well as the typical libraries that you would use with it. We will first cover what
you need to know to build your own auto-configuration and we will move on to the
<<boot-features-custom-starter,typical steps required to create a custom starter>>.

TIP: A https://github.com/snicoll-demos/spring-boot-master-auto-configuration[demo project]
is available to showcase how you can create a starter step by step.



[[boot-features-understanding-auto-configured-beans]]
=== Understanding auto-configured beans
Under the hood, auto-configuration is implemented with standard `@Configuration` classes.
Additional `@Conditional` annotations are used to constrain when the auto-configuration
should apply. Usually auto-configuration classes use `@ConditionalOnClass` and
`@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations. This ensures that auto-configuration only applies
when relevant classes are found and when you have not declared your own `@Configuration`.

You can browse the source code of {sc-spring-boot-autoconfigure}[`spring-boot-autoconfigure`]
to see the `@Configuration` classes that we provide (see the
{github-code}/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories[`META-INF/spring.factories`]
file).



[[boot-features-locating-auto-configuration-candidates]]
=== Locating auto-configuration candidates
Spring Boot checks for the presence of a `META-INF/spring.factories` file within your
published jar. The file should list your configuration classes under the
`EnableAutoConfiguration` key.

[indent=0]
----
	org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=\
	com.mycorp.libx.autoconfigure.LibXAutoConfiguration,\
	com.mycorp.libx.autoconfigure.LibXWebAutoConfiguration
----

You can use the
{sc-spring-boot-autoconfigure}/AutoConfigureAfter.{sc-ext}[`@AutoConfigureAfter`] or
{sc-spring-boot-autoconfigure}/AutoConfigureBefore.{sc-ext}[`@AutoConfigureBefore`]
annotations if your configuration needs to be applied in a specific order. For example, if
you provide web-specific configuration, your class may need to be applied after
`WebMvcAutoConfiguration`.

If you want to order certain auto-configurations that shouldn't have any direct
knowledge of each other, you can also use `@AutoConfigureOrder`. That annotation has the
same semantic as the regular `@Order` annotation but provides a dedicated order for
auto-configuration classes.

[NOTE]
====
Auto-configurations have to be loaded that way _only_. Make sure that they are defined in
a specific package space and that they are never the target of component scan in
particular.
====



[[boot-features-condition-annotations]]
=== Condition annotations
You almost always want to include one or more `@Conditional` annotations on your
auto-configuration class. The `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` is one common example that is
used to allow developers to '`override`' auto-configuration if they are not happy with
your defaults.

Spring Boot includes a number of `@Conditional` annotations that you can reuse in your own
code by annotating `@Configuration` classes or individual `@Bean` methods.



[[boot-features-class-conditions]]
==== Class conditions
The `@ConditionalOnClass` and `@ConditionalOnMissingClass` annotations allows
configuration to be included based on the presence or absence of specific classes. Due to
the fact that annotation metadata is parsed using http://asm.ow2.org/[ASM] you can
actually use the `value` attribute to refer to the real class, even though that class
might not actually appear on the running application classpath. You can also use the
`name` attribute if you prefer to specify the class name using a `String` value.

[TIP]
====
If you are using `@ConditionalOnClass` or `@ConditionalOnMissingClass` as a part of a
meta-annotation to compose your own composed annotations you must use `name` as referring
to the class in such a case is not handled.
====



[[boot-features-bean-conditions]]
==== Bean conditions
The `@ConditionalOnBean` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations allow a bean
to be included based on the presence or absence of specific beans. You can use the `value`
attribute to specify beans by type, or `name` to specify beans by name. The `search`
attribute allows you to limit the `ApplicationContext` hierarchy that should be considered
when searching for beans.

When placed on a `@Bean` method, the target type defaults to the return type of the
method, for instance:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Configuration
	public class MyAutoConfiguration {

		@Bean
		@ConditionalOnMissingBean
		public MyService myService() { ... }

	}
----

In the example above, the `myService` bean is going to be created if no bean of type
`MyService` is already contained in the `ApplicationContext`.

TIP: You need to be very careful about the order that bean definitions are added as these
conditions are evaluated based on what has been processed so far. For this reason,
we recommend only using `@ConditionalOnBean` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations
on auto-configuration classes (since these are guaranteed to load after any user-defined
beans definitions have been added).

NOTE: `@ConditionalOnBean` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` do not prevent `@Configuration`
classes from being created. The only difference between using these conditions at the class level
and marking each contained `@Bean` method with the annotation is that the former prevents
registration of the `@Configuration` class as a bean if the condition does not match.



[[boot-features-property-conditions]]
==== Property conditions
The `@ConditionalOnProperty` annotation allows configuration to be included based on a
Spring Environment property. Use the `prefix` and `name` attributes to specify the
property that should be checked. By default any property that exists and is not equal to
`false` will be matched. You can also create more advanced checks using the `havingValue`
and `matchIfMissing` attributes.



[[boot-features-resource-conditions]]
==== Resource conditions
The `@ConditionalOnResource` annotation allows configuration to be included only when a
specific resource is present. Resources can be specified using the usual Spring
conventions, for example, `file:/home/user/test.dat`.



[[boot-features-web-application-conditions]]
==== Web application conditions
The `@ConditionalOnWebApplication` and `@ConditionalOnNotWebApplication` annotations
allow configuration to be included depending on whether the application is a 'web
application'. A web application is any application that is using a Spring
`WebApplicationContext`, defines a `session` scope or has a `StandardServletEnvironment`.



[[boot-features-spel-conditions]]
==== SpEL expression conditions
The `@ConditionalOnExpression` annotation allows configuration to be included based on the
result of a {spring-reference}/#expressions[SpEL expression].



[[boot-features-custom-starter]]
=== Creating your own starter
A full Spring Boot starter for a library may contain the following components:

* The `autoconfigure` module that contains the auto-configuration code.
* The `starter` module that provides a dependency to the autoconfigure module as well as
  the library and any additional dependencies that are typically useful. In a nutshell,
  adding the starter should be enough to start using that library.

TIP: You may combine the auto-configuration code and the dependency management in a single
module if you don't need to separate those two concerns.



[[boot-features-custom-starter-naming]]
==== Naming
Please make sure to provide a proper namespace for your starter. Do not start your module
names with `spring-boot`, even if you are using a different Maven groupId. We may offer an
official support for the thing you're auto-configuring in the future.

Here is a rule of thumb. Let's assume that you are creating a starter for "acme", name the
auto-configure module `acme-spring-boot-autoconfigure` and the starter
`acme-spring-boot-starter`. If you only have one module combining the two, use
`acme-spring-boot-starter`.

Besides, if your starter provides configuration keys, use a proper namespace for them. In
particular, do not include your keys in the namespaces that Spring Boot uses (e.g.
`server`, `management`, `spring`, etc). These are "ours" and we may improve/modify them
in the future in such a way it could break your things.

Make sure to
<<appendix-configuration-metadata#configuration-metadata-annotation-processor,trigger
meta-data generation>> so that IDE assistance is available for your keys as well. You
may want to review the generated meta-data (`META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json`)
to make sure your keys are properly documented.



[[boot-features-custom-starter-module-autoconfigure]]
==== Autoconfigure module
The autoconfigure module contains everything that is necessary to get started with the
library. It may also contain configuration keys definition (`@ConfigurationProperties`)
and any callback interface that can be used to further customize how the components are
initialized.

TIP: You should mark the dependencies to the library as optional so that you can include
the autoconfigure module in your projects more easily. If you do it that way, the library
won't be provided and Spring Boot will back off by default.

Spring Boot uses an annotation processor to collect the conditions on auto-configurations
in a metadata file (`META-INF/spring-autoconfigure-metadata.properties`). If that file is
present, it is used to eagerly filter auto-configurations that do not match, which will
improve startup time. It is recommended to add the following dependency in a module that
contains auto-configurations:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor</artifactId>
		<optional>true</optional>
	</dependency>
----

With Gradle you would add:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	dependencies {
		compileOnly "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor"
	}
----



[[boot-features-custom-starter-module-starter]]
==== Starter module
The starter is an empty jar, really. Its only purpose is to provide the necessary
dependencies to work with the library; see it as an opinionated view of what is required
to get started.

Do not make assumptions about the project in which your starter is added. If the library
you are auto-configuring typically requires other starters, mention them as well. Providing
a proper set of _default_ dependencies may be hard if the number of optional dependencies
is high as you should avoid bringing unnecessary dependencies for a typical usage of the
library.

NOTE: Either way, your starter must reference the core Spring Boot starter
(`spring-boot-starter`) directly or indirectly (i.e. no need to add it if your starter
relies on another starter). If a project is created with only your custom starter, Spring
Boot's core features will be honoured by the presence of the core starter.
