== Caching
The Spring Framework provides support for transparently adding caching to an application.
At its core, the abstraction applies caching to methods, reducing thus the number of
executions based on the information available in the cache. The caching logic is applied
transparently, without any interference to the invoker.  Spring Boot auto-configures the
cache infrastructure as long as the caching support is enabled via the `@EnableCaching`
annotation.

NOTE: Check the {spring-reference}/#cache[relevant section] of the Spring Framework
reference for more details.

In a nutshell, adding caching to an operation of your service is as easy as adding the
relevant annotation to its method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    import org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable
	import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

	@Component
	public class MathService {

		@Cacheable("piDecimals")
		public int computePiDecimal(int i) {
			// ...
		}

	}
----

This example demonstrates the use of caching on a potentially costly operation. Before
invoking `computePiDecimal`, the abstraction will look for an entry in the `piDecimals`
cache matching the `i` argument. If an entry is found, the content in the cache is
immediately returned to the caller and the method is not invoked. Otherwise, the method is
invoked and the cache is updated before returning the value.

NOTE: You can also use the standard JSR-107 (JCache) annotations (e.g. `@CacheResult`)
transparently. We strongly advise you however to not mix and match them.

If you do not add any specific cache library, Spring Boot will auto-configure a
<<boot-features-caching-provider-simple,Simple provider>> that uses concurrent maps in
memory. When a cache is required (i.e. `piDecimals` in the example above), this provider
will create it on-the-fly for you. The simple provider is not really recommended for
production usage, but it's great for getting started and making sure that you understand
the features. When you have made up your mind about the cache provider to use, please make
sure to read its documentation to figure out how to configure the caches that your
application uses. Practically all providers require you to explicitly configure every
cache that you use in the application. Some offer a way to customize the default caches
defined by the `spring.cache.cache-names` property.

TIP: It is also possible to {spring-reference}/#cache-annotations-put[update] or
{spring-reference}/#cache-annotations-evict[evict] data from the cache transparently.

NOTE: If you are using the cache infrastructure with beans that are not interface-based,
make sure to enable the `proxyTargetClass` attribute of `@EnableCaching`.



[[boot-features-caching-provider]]
=== Supported cache providers
The cache abstraction does not provide an actual store and relies on abstraction
materialized by the `org.springframework.cache.Cache` and
`org.springframework.cache.CacheManager` interfaces.

If you haven't defined a bean of type `CacheManager` or a `CacheResolver` named
`cacheResolver` (see `CachingConfigurer`), Spring Boot tries to detect the following
providers (in this order):

* <<boot-features-caching-provider-generic,Generic>>
* <<boot-features-caching-provider-jcache,JCache (JSR-107)>> (EhCache 3, Hazelcast,
  Infinispan, etc)
* <<boot-features-caching-provider-ehcache2,EhCache 2.x>>
* <<boot-features-caching-provider-hazelcast,Hazelcast>>
* <<boot-features-caching-provider-infinispan,Infinispan>>
* <<boot-features-caching-provider-couchbase,Couchbase>>
* <<boot-features-caching-provider-redis,Redis>>
* <<boot-features-caching-provider-caffeine,Caffeine>>
* <<boot-features-caching-provider-guava,Guava>> (deprecated)
* <<boot-features-caching-provider-simple,Simple>>

TIP: It is also possible to _force_ the cache provider to use via the `spring.cache.type`
property. Use this property if you need to <<boot-features-caching-provider-none,disable
caching altogether>> in certain environment (e.g. tests).

TIP: Use the `spring-boot-starter-cache` '`Starter`' to quickly add basic caching
dependencies. The starter brings in `spring-context-support`: if you are adding
dependencies manually, you must include `spring-context-support` in order to use the
JCache, EhCache 2.x or Guava support.

If the `CacheManager` is auto-configured by Spring Boot, you can further tune its
configuration before it is fully initialized by exposing a bean implementing the
`CacheManagerCustomizer` interface. The following sets a flag to say that null
values should be passed down to the underlying map.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Bean
	public CacheManagerCustomizer<ConcurrentMapCacheManager> cacheManagerCustomizer() {
		return new CacheManagerCustomizer<ConcurrentMapCacheManager>() {
			@Override
			public void customize(ConcurrentMapCacheManager cacheManager) {
				cacheManager.setAllowNullValues(false);
			}
		};
	}
----

[NOTE]
====
In the example above, an auto-configured `ConcurrentMapCacheManager` is expected. If that
is not the case (either you provided your own config or a different cache provider was
auto-configured), the customizer won't be invoked at all. You can have as many customizers
as you want and you can also order them as usual using `@Order` or `Ordered`.
====



[[boot-features-caching-provider-generic]]
==== Generic
Generic caching is used if the context defines _at least_ one
`org.springframework.cache.Cache` bean. A `CacheManager` wrapping all beans of that type
is created.



[[boot-features-caching-provider-jcache]]
==== JCache (JSR-107)
JCache is bootstrapped via the presence of a `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider` on the
classpath (i.e. a JSR-107 compliant caching library) and the `JCacheCacheManager`
provided by the `spring-boot-starter-cache` '`Starter`'. There are various compliant
libraries out there and Spring Boot provides dependency management for Ehcache 3,
Hazelcast and Infinispan. Any other compliant library can be added as well.

It might happen that more than one provider is present, in which case the provider must
be explicitly specified. Even if the JSR-107 standard does not enforce a standardized
way to define the location of the configuration file, Spring Boot does its best to
accommodate with implementation details.

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
    # Only necessary if more than one provider is present
	spring.cache.jcache.provider=com.acme.MyCachingProvider
	spring.cache.jcache.config=classpath:acme.xml
----

NOTE: Since a cache library may offer both a native implementation and JSR-107 support
Spring Boot will prefer the JSR-107 support so that the same features are available if
you switch to a different JSR-107 implementation.

TIP: Spring Boot has a <<boot-features-hazelcast,general support for Hazelcast>>. If
a single `HazelcastInstance` is available, it is automatically reused for the
`CacheManager` as well unless the `spring.cache.jcache.config` property is specified.

There are several ways to customize the underlying `javax.cache.cacheManager`:

* Caches can be created on startup via the `spring.cache.cache-names` property. If a
  custom `javax.cache.configuration.Configuration` bean is defined, it is used to
  customize them.
* `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache.JCacheManagerCustomizer` beans are
  invoked with the reference of the `CacheManager` for full customization.

TIP: If a standard `javax.cache.CacheManager` bean is defined, it is wrapped
automatically in a `org.springframework.cache.CacheManager` implementation that the
abstraction expects. No further customization is applied on it.



[[boot-features-caching-provider-ehcache2]]
==== EhCache 2.x
EhCache 2.x is used if a file named `ehcache.xml` can be found at the root of the
classpath. If EhCache 2.x, the `EhCacheCacheManager` provided by the
`spring-boot-starter-cache` '`Starter`' and such file is present it is used to bootstrap
the cache manager. An alternate configuration file can be provided as well using:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.cache.ehcache.config=classpath:config/another-config.xml
----



[[boot-features-caching-provider-hazelcast]]
==== Hazelcast

Spring Boot has a <<boot-features-hazelcast,general support for Hazelcast>>. If
a `HazelcastInstance` has been auto-configured, it is automatically wrapped in a
`CacheManager`.



[[boot-features-caching-provider-infinispan]]
==== Infinispan
Infinispan has no default configuration file location so it must be specified explicitly
(or the default bootstrap is used).

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.cache.infinispan.config=infinispan.xml
----

Caches can be created on startup via the `spring.cache.cache-names` property. If a custom
`ConfigurationBuilder` bean is defined, it is used to customize them.

[NOTE]
====
The support of Infinispan in Spring Boot is restricted to the embedded mode and is quite
basic. If you want more options you should use the official Infinispan Spring Boot starter
instead, check
https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-spring-boot[the documentation] for more details.
====


[[boot-features-caching-provider-couchbase]]
==== Couchbase
If the Couchbase java client and the `couchbase-spring-cache` implementation are
available and Couchbase is <<boot-features-couchbase,configured>>, a
`CouchbaseCacheManager` will be auto-configured. It is also possible to create additional
caches on startup using the `spring.cache.cache-names` property. These will operate on
the `Bucket` that was auto-configured. You can _also_ create additional caches on another
`Bucket` using the customizer: assume you need two caches on the "main" `Bucket` (`foo`
and `bar`) and one `biz` cache with a custom time to live of 2sec on the `another`
`Bucket`. First, you can create the two first caches simply via configuration:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.cache.cache-names=foo,bar
----

Then define this extra `@Configuration` to configure the extra `Bucket` and the `biz`
cache:


[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Configuration
	public class CouchbaseCacheConfiguration {

		private final Cluster cluster;

		public CouchbaseCacheConfiguration(Cluster cluster) {
			this.cluster = cluster;
		}

		@Bean
		public Bucket anotherBucket() {
			return this.cluster.openBucket("another", "secret");
		}

		@Bean
		public CacheManagerCustomizer<CouchbaseCacheManager> cacheManagerCustomizer() {
			return c -> {
				c.prepareCache("biz", CacheBuilder.newInstance(anotherBucket())
						.withExpiration(2));
			};
		}

	}
----

This sample configuration reuses the `Cluster` that was created via auto-configuration.



[[boot-features-caching-provider-redis]]
==== Redis
If Redis is available and configured, the `RedisCacheManager` is auto-configured. It is
also possible to create additional caches on startup using the `spring.cache.cache-names`
property.

[NOTE]
====
By default, a key prefix is added to prevent that if two separate caches use the same
key, Redis would have overlapping keys and be likely to return invalid values. We strongly
recommend to keep this setting enabled if you create your own `RedisCacheManager`.
====



[[boot-features-caching-provider-caffeine]]
==== Caffeine
Caffeine is a Java 8 rewrite of Guava’s cache and will supersede the Guava support in
Spring Boot 2.0. If Caffeine is present, a `CaffeineCacheManager` (provided by the
`spring-boot-starter-cache` '`Starter`') is auto-configured. Caches can be created on
startup using the `spring.cache.cache-names` property and customized by one of the
following (in this order):

1. A cache spec defined by `spring.cache.caffeine.spec`
2. A `com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.CaffeineSpec` bean is defined
3. A `com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.Caffeine` bean is defined

For instance, the following configuration creates a `foo` and `bar` caches with a maximum
size of 500 and a _time to live_ of 10 minutes

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
    spring.cache.cache-names=foo,bar
	spring.cache.caffeine.spec=maximumSize=500,expireAfterAccess=600s
----

Besides, if a `com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.CacheLoader` bean is defined, it is
automatically associated to the `CaffeineCacheManager`. Since the `CacheLoader` is
going to be associated to _all_ caches managed by the cache manager, it must be defined
as `CacheLoader<Object, Object>`. Any other generic type will be ignored by the
auto-configuration.



[[boot-features-caching-provider-guava]]
==== Guava (deprecated)
If Guava is present, a `GuavaCacheManager` is auto-configured. Caches can be created
on startup using the `spring.cache.cache-names` property and customized by one of the
following (in this order):

1. A cache spec defined by `spring.cache.guava.spec`
2. A `com.google.common.cache.CacheBuilderSpec` bean is defined
3. A `com.google.common.cache.CacheBuilder` bean is defined

For instance, the following configuration creates a `foo` and `bar` caches with a maximum
size of 500 and a _time to live_ of 10 minutes

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
    spring.cache.cache-names=foo,bar
	spring.cache.guava.spec=maximumSize=500,expireAfterAccess=600s
----

Besides, if a `com.google.common.cache.CacheLoader` bean is defined, it is automatically
associated to the `GuavaCacheManager`. Since the `CacheLoader` is going to be associated
to _all_ caches managed by the cache manager, it must be defined as
`CacheLoader<Object, Object>`. Any other generic type will be ignored by the
auto-configuration.



[[boot-features-caching-provider-simple]]
==== Simple
If none of the other providers can be found, a simple implementation using a
`ConcurrentHashMap` as cache store is configured. This is the default if no caching
library is present in your application. Caches are created on-the-fly by default but you
can restrict the list of available caches using the `cache-names` property. For instance,
if you want only `foo` and `bar` caches:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
    spring.cache.cache-names=foo,bar
----

If you do this and your application uses a cache not listed then it will fail at runtime
when the cache is needed, but not on startup. This is similar to the way the "real" cache
providers behave if you use an undeclared cache.


[[boot-features-caching-provider-none]]
==== None
When `@EnableCaching` is present in your configuration, a suitable cache configuration
is expected as well. If you need to disable caching altogether in certain environments,
force the cache type to `none` to use a no-op implementation:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.cache.type=none
----
