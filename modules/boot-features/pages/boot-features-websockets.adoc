== WebSockets
Spring Boot provides WebSockets auto-configuration for embedded Tomcat (8 and 7), Jetty 9
and Undertow. If you're deploying a war file to a standalone container, Spring Boot
assumes that the container will be responsible for the configuration of its WebSocket
support.

Spring Framework provides {spring-reference}/#websocket[rich WebSocket support] that can
be easily accessed via the `spring-boot-starter-websocket` module.
