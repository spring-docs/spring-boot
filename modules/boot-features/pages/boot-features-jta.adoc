== Distributed Transactions with JTA
Spring Boot supports distributed JTA transactions across multiple XA resources by using either an https://www.atomikos.com/[Atomikos] or https://github.com/bitronix/btm[Bitronix] embedded transaction manager.
JTA transactions are also supported when deploying to a suitable Java EE Application Server.

When a JTA environment is detected, Spring's `JtaTransactionManager` is used to manage transactions.
Auto-configured JMS, DataSource, and JPA beans are upgraded to support XA transactions.
You can use standard Spring idioms, such as `@Transactional`, to participate in a distributed transaction.
If you are within a JTA environment and still want to use local transactions, you can set the configprop:spring.jta.enabled[] property to `false` to disable the JTA auto-configuration.



[[boot-features-jta-atomikos]]
=== Using an Atomikos Transaction Manager
https://www.atomikos.com/[Atomikos] is a popular open source transaction manager which can be embedded into your Spring Boot application.
You can use the `spring-boot-starter-jta-atomikos` starter to pull in the appropriate Atomikos libraries.
Spring Boot auto-configures Atomikos and ensures that appropriate `depends-on` settings are applied to your Spring beans for correct startup and shutdown ordering.

By default, Atomikos transaction logs are written to a `transaction-logs` directory in your application's home directory (the directory in which your application jar file resides).
You can customize the location of this directory by setting a configprop:spring.jta.log-dir[] property in your `application.properties` file.
Properties starting with `spring.jta.atomikos.properties` can also be used to customize the Atomikos `UserTransactionServiceImp`.
See the {spring-boot-module-api}/jta/atomikos/AtomikosProperties.html[`AtomikosProperties` Javadoc] for complete details.

NOTE: To ensure that multiple transaction managers can safely coordinate the same resource managers, each Atomikos instance must be configured with a unique ID.
By default, this ID is the IP address of the machine on which Atomikos is running.
To ensure uniqueness in production, you should configure the configprop:spring.jta.transaction-manager-id[] property with a different value for each instance of your application.



[[boot-features-jta-bitronix]]
=== Using a Bitronix Transaction Manager
https://github.com/bitronix/btm[Bitronix] is a popular open-source JTA transaction manager implementation.
You can use the `spring-boot-starter-jta-bitronix` starter to add the appropriate Bitronix dependencies to your project.
As with Atomikos, Spring Boot automatically configures Bitronix and post-processes your beans to ensure that startup and shutdown ordering is correct.

By default, Bitronix transaction log files (`part1.btm` and `part2.btm`) are written to a `transaction-logs` directory in your application home directory.
You can customize the location of this directory by setting the configprop:spring.jta.log-dir[] property.
Properties starting with `spring.jta.bitronix.properties` are also bound to the `bitronix.tm.Configuration` bean, allowing for complete customization.
See the https://github.com/bitronix/btm/wiki/Transaction-manager-configuration[Bitronix documentation] for details.

NOTE: To ensure that multiple transaction managers can safely coordinate the same resource managers, each Bitronix instance must be configured with a unique ID.
By default, this ID is the IP address of the machine on which Bitronix is running.
To ensure uniqueness in production, you should configure the configprop:spring.jta.transaction-manager-id[] property with a different value for each instance of your application.



[[boot-features-jta-javaee]]
=== Using a Java EE Managed Transaction Manager
If you package your Spring Boot application as a `war` or `ear` file and deploy it to a Java EE application server, you can use your application server's built-in transaction manager.
Spring Boot tries to auto-configure a transaction manager by looking at common JNDI locations (`java:comp/UserTransaction`, `java:comp/TransactionManager`, and so on).
If you use a transaction service provided by your application server, you generally also want to ensure that all resources are managed by the server and exposed over JNDI.
Spring Boot tries to auto-configure JMS by looking for a `ConnectionFactory` at the JNDI path (`java:/JmsXA` or `java:/XAConnectionFactory`), and you can use the <<boot-features-connecting-to-a-jndi-datasource, configprop:spring.datasource.jndi-name[] property>> to configure your `DataSource`.



[[boot-features-jta-mixed-jms]]
=== Mixing XA and Non-XA JMS Connections
When using JTA, the primary JMS `ConnectionFactory` bean is XA-aware and participates in distributed transactions.
In some situations, you might want to process certain JMS messages by using a non-XA `ConnectionFactory`.
For example, your JMS processing logic might take longer than the XA timeout.

If you want to use a non-XA `ConnectionFactory`, you can inject the `nonXaJmsConnectionFactory` bean rather than the `@Primary` `jmsConnectionFactory` bean.
For consistency, the `jmsConnectionFactory` bean is also provided by using the bean alias `xaJmsConnectionFactory`.

The following example shows how to inject `ConnectionFactory` instances:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	// Inject the primary (XA aware) ConnectionFactory
	@Autowired
	private ConnectionFactory defaultConnectionFactory;

	// Inject the XA aware ConnectionFactory (uses the alias and injects the same as above)
	@Autowired
	@Qualifier("xaJmsConnectionFactory")
	private ConnectionFactory xaConnectionFactory;

	// Inject the non-XA aware ConnectionFactory
	@Autowired
	@Qualifier("nonXaJmsConnectionFactory")
	private ConnectionFactory nonXaConnectionFactory;
----



[[boot-features-jta-supporting-alternative-embedded]]
=== Supporting an Alternative Embedded Transaction Manager
The {spring-boot-module-code}/jms/XAConnectionFactoryWrapper.java[`XAConnectionFactoryWrapper`] and {spring-boot-module-code}/jdbc/XADataSourceWrapper.java[`XADataSourceWrapper`] interfaces can be used to support alternative embedded transaction managers.
The interfaces are responsible for wrapping `XAConnectionFactory` and `XADataSource` beans and exposing them as regular `ConnectionFactory` and `DataSource` beans, which transparently enroll in the distributed transaction.
DataSource and JMS auto-configuration use JTA variants, provided you have a `JtaTransactionManager` bean and appropriate XA wrapper beans registered within your `ApplicationContext`.

The {spring-boot-module-code}/jta/bitronix/BitronixXAConnectionFactoryWrapper.java[BitronixXAConnectionFactoryWrapper] and {spring-boot-module-code}/jta/bitronix/BitronixXADataSourceWrapper.java[BitronixXADataSourceWrapper] provide good examples of how to write XA wrappers.
