== Spring Session
Spring Boot provides {spring-session}[Spring Session] auto-configuration for a wide range of data stores.
When building a Servlet web application, the following stores can be auto-configured:

* JDBC
* Redis
* Hazelcast
* MongoDB

When building a reactive web application, the following stores can be auto-configured:

* Redis
* MongoDB

If a single Spring Session module is present on the classpath, Spring Boot uses that store implementation automatically.
If you have more than one implementation, you must choose the {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/session/StoreType.java[`StoreType`] that you wish to use to store the sessions.
For instance, to use JDBC as the back-end store, you can configure your application as follows:

[source,properties,indent=0,configprops]
----
    spring.session.store-type=jdbc
----

TIP: You can disable Spring Session by setting the `store-type` to `none`.

Each store has specific additional settings.
For instance, it is possible to customize the name of the table for the JDBC store, as shown in the following example:

[source,properties,indent=0,configprops]
----
    spring.session.jdbc.table-name=SESSIONS
----

For setting the timeout of the session you can use the configprop:spring.session.timeout[] property.
If that property is not set, the auto-configuration falls back to the value of configprop:server.servlet.session.timeout[].
