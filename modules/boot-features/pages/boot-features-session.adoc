== Spring Session
Spring Boot provides Spring Session auto-configuration for a wide range of stores:

* JDBC
* MongoDB
* Redis
* Hazelcast
* HashMap

If Spring Session is available, you must choose the
{sc-spring-boot-autoconfigure}/session/StoreType.{sc-ext}[`StoreType`] that you wish to
use to store the sessions. For instance to use JDBC as backend store, you'd configure
your application as follows:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
    spring.session.store-type=jdbc
----

TIP: You can disable Spring Session by setting the `store-type` to `none`.

Each store has specific additional settings. For instance it is possible to customize
the name of the table for the jdbc store:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
    spring.session.jdbc.table-name=SESSIONS
----
