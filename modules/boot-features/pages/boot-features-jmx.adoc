== Monitoring and management over JMX
Java Management Extensions (JMX) provide a standard mechanism to monitor and manage
applications. By default Spring Boot will create an `MBeanServer` with bean id
'`mbeanServer`' and expose any of your beans that are annotated with Spring JMX
annotations (`@ManagedResource`, `@ManagedAttribute`, `@ManagedOperation`).

See the
{sc-spring-boot-autoconfigure}/jmx/JmxAutoConfiguration.{sc-ext}[`JmxAutoConfiguration`]
class for more details.
