== Calling REST Services with `RestTemplate`
If you need to call remote REST services from your application, you can use the Spring Framework's {spring-framework-api}/web/client/RestTemplate.html[`RestTemplate`] class.
Since `RestTemplate` instances often need to be customized before being used, Spring Boot does not provide any single auto-configured `RestTemplate` bean.
It does, however, auto-configure a `RestTemplateBuilder`, which can be used to create `RestTemplate` instances when needed.
The auto-configured `RestTemplateBuilder` ensures that sensible `HttpMessageConverters` are applied to `RestTemplate` instances.

The following code shows a typical example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Service
	public class MyService {

		private final RestTemplate restTemplate;

		public MyService(RestTemplateBuilder restTemplateBuilder) {
			this.restTemplate = restTemplateBuilder.build();
		}

		public Details someRestCall(String name) {
			return this.restTemplate.getForObject("/{name}/details", Details.class, name);
		}

	}
----

TIP: `RestTemplateBuilder` includes a number of useful methods that can be used to quickly configure a `RestTemplate`.
For example, to add BASIC auth support, you can use `builder.basicAuthentication("user", "password").build()`.



[[boot-features-resttemplate-customization]]
=== RestTemplate Customization
There are three main approaches to `RestTemplate` customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.

To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured `RestTemplateBuilder` and then call its methods as required.
Each method call returns a new `RestTemplateBuilder` instance, so the customizations only affect this use of the builder.

To make an application-wide, additive customization, use a `RestTemplateCustomizer` bean.
All such beans are automatically registered with the auto-configured `RestTemplateBuilder` and are applied to any templates that are built with it.

The following example shows a customizer that configures the use of a proxy for all hosts except `192.168.0.5`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{code-examples}/web/client/RestTemplateProxyCustomizationExample.java[tag=customizer]
----

Finally, the most extreme (and rarely used) option is to create your own `RestTemplateBuilder` bean.
Doing so switches off the auto-configuration of a `RestTemplateBuilder` and prevents any `RestTemplateCustomizer` beans from being used.
